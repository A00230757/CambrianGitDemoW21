Hi! My name is Vinesh Thakur. My favorite animal is human. These are a species of highly intelligent primates.
They are terrestrial animals, characterized by their erect posture and bipedal locomotion; high manual dexterity and heavy tool use compared to other animals; open-ended and complex language use compared to other animal communications; larger, more complex brains than other primates; and highly advanced and organized societies.

With training, they can attain all the skills necessary to create robust mobile applications.

In this semester, I hope to learn more about mobile application development for various platforms.
